Download the data from the Raisin Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Raisin+Dataset

Using the attached code, split the data into train and validation, then train a logistic regression model.

Using this model, do the following using the F1 score:
1) Compute overall F1 score.
2) Choose any three features, split by the average value, and compute the F1 score on each slice. This should result in six F1 scores.
3) Write a brief model card giving high level details about the model, intended use metrics, data, and potential bias.
